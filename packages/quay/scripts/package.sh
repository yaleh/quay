# package.sh — build a distributable quay release artifact via npm pack.
#
# QX-033 (experiment 4, iteration 9): closes CB-008 (no packaging/distribution).
# Approach: Option B (npm pack) — produces a self-contained .tgz that users can
# install globally via `npm install -g quay-<version>.tgz` without cloning the repo.
#
# Node SEA was evaluated and deferred: it requires bundling all dependencies
# (yaml, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk) into a single file. Without a bundler like
# esbuild present, the bundling step would require a separate toolchain installation.
# npm pack is simpler, universally available with Node.js, and produces a package
# that respects the existing ESM entry points and bin field in package.json.
#
# Usage:
#   bash packages/quay/scripts/package.sh
#   # or from packages/quay/:
#   bash scripts/package.sh
#
# Output: quay-<version>.tgz in the current directory (wherever npm pack is run from).

# M120 (DIR-060): build the bundled ESM dist/quay.js BEFORE npm pack. The `bin`
# field points at ./dist/quay.js (Node-20-runnable) — native .ts needs Node
# >=23, so the raw bin/quay.ts entrypoint fails on the declared floor. dist/ is
# gitignored (generated, like dist-sea/), so it MUST be built here every pack.

# The --pack-destination flag (npm >=7) puts the .tgz in the caller's original
# directory instead; omitting it puts it in PACKAGE_DIR, which is fine for CI.
