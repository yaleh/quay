// serve-i18n.ts — the ONE label dictionary for the quay web face's shared chrome (AC-289 / GOAL-024).
//
// ============================ CONTRACT (single source of truth) ============================
// `serve-lang.ts` answers "which language is this request?"; this file answers "what is this label
// in that language?". They are separate modules on purpose: a page that needs only the `<html lang>`
// attribute must not have to import 15 label pairs, and a test of the DECISION TABLE must not
// depend on the dictionary's CONTENTS.
//
// ROW 1 — ONE dictionary, peer columns. `NAV_LABELS` is the only place a nav label is written. The
//   `en` column is byte-equal to the 15 labels the nav rendered before this module existed — that
//   is the AC-289 baseline the goal criterion reads off the LIVE page — and it is ⛔ NOT derived
//   from the zh column by any fallback. The two columns are peers, not a source and its translation.
//
// ROW 2 — the roster is CLOSED and a missing word is an ERROR. `NAV_KEYS` is the 15-view union and
//   `NAV_LABELS` is typed `Record<NavKey, …>`, so a view added without a word in BOTH columns is a
//   type error. At runtime an unknown key THROWS — it never falls back to English (硬规则 3b: a
//   reader that cannot find the word it was asked for must say so, never return the word it did
//   find; a silently-English nav item is indistinguishable from an untranslated one, which is the
//   exact defect AC-289 exists to remove).
//
// ROW 3 — `PAGE_LABELS` is the PAGE-CHROME dictionary, keyed by the page's OWN English token (the
//   same token `pageTitle` receives). It is deliberately SMALLER than NAV_LABELS: only /dashboard
//   is wired here, because that is AC-289's scope; the other 14 pages' page-chrome is AC-290~303.
//   `en` is the identity for EVERY token (so the en baseline is byte-identical by construction);
//   an unmapped token under `zh` renders its English token unchanged — a VISIBLE degradation (the
//   page reads English), never a blank or undefined title.
//
// WHY THE zh COLUMN IS ASSERTED TO NOT CONTAIN "Dashboard": the goal criterion reads the live nav
//   region and fails on the literal English label. A zh value that still carried the English word
//   (e.g. "Dashboard 面板") would satisfy "the value is non-empty" while defeating the assertion the
//   value exists to satisfy — so the test asserts the absent literal directly rather than trusting
//   a column that merely looks translated.
// ==========================================================================================
